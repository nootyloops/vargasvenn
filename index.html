  <h1> MICHELLE'S APUSH MAGNUM OPUS </h1>
  <h4 class=home1> Hi Mr. Vargas do you like New England furniture? I was reading about colonial early furniture the other day and it was really interesting. The book The Goldfinch focuses on furniture too. Btw, the book is good but the movie adaptation just came out and people really don't like that. Other then that I was watching Pawn Stars one day and they brought in a set of silver spoons Paul Revere made which I thought was pretty cool.  :)  </h4>
