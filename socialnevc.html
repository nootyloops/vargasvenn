    <h3> New England Colonies </h3>
   <h4 class="secondbox"> 	★ Very unified; united by religion, strong sense of community
   </h4>
   <h4 class="secondbox"> 	★ Therefore, no severe class differences, in fact acts were even passed to stabilize and lessen class differences
   </h4>
   <h4 class="secondbox"> 	★ Generally frowned upon slavery, as society and economy had no physical or mental use/need of slavery
     </h4>
     <h4 class="secondbox"> 	★ Much less class difference, no huge difference due to societal attitudes
   </h4>
     <h4 class="secondbox"> 	★ Motive for coming to New World originally was mostly for religious freedom, therefore society overall was more focused on unity, church, and so forth
   </h4>
    <h4 class="secondbox"> 	★ Colonized as the "scripture" demanded, again motives shaped societal views and ideals
      </h4>
    <h4 class="secondbox"> 	★ Society mostly composed of commonfolk, farmers, religious figures etc. not much societal differences or economic viewpoints when contrasted with Cheasepeake colonies
    </h4>
    <h4 class="secondbox"> 	★ Much longer lifespan, due partly to societal expectations of work, lifestyle, and the ability to set up families -said that they "invented" grandparents
      </h4>
    <h4 class="secondbox"> 	★ Likewise, cool climate lessened spread of diseases and better air quality -better quality of life
        </h4>
    <h4 class="secondbox"> 	★ Low divorce rate, general family stability
          </h4>
    <h4 class="secondbox"> 	★ Encouraged education, high literacy
