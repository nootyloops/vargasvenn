<div>
<h6 class="toleft"> Question 1 </h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Time Period: 1, 1491-1607 </h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Key Concept: 1.1 A </h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Themes: Culture and Society </h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Skills: Contextualization </h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Question: Evaluate the cultural and economical impact maize
  had on early Native American societies.</h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Thesis Statement: Maize was held in cultural regard as a
  grain from the gods, alongside its role as key crop for modern day corn,
  spreading from South America to North America. This was crucial, as in societies both past and future relied
heavily on cheap carbs and energy to fuel nations.</h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Connections: </h6>
<h6 class="toleft">	☆ Cash crops, although not for food, people also heavily depended on crops </h6>
<h6 class="toleft">	☆ Cultural signifigance, food viewed as sacred/from the Gods (ex: Ambrosia; Greece) </h6>
<h6 class="toleft">	☆ Economically, used for trade, although more valuable trading foodstuffs were used too </h6>
<h6 class="toleft">	☆ Tribute system, maize was a part, similiar to European tribute systems </h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Contextuality:</h6>
<h6 class="toleft">	☆ Most nations in South America relied on Maize heavily for food </h6>
<h6 class="toleft">	☆ Crucial, provided most raw and cheap energy </h6>
<h6 class="toleft">	☆ Predecessor to modern corn </h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Complexity: While maize was popular, similiar crops such as the 3 sisters or cacao were just as important and valued in Native American societies. </h6>
<br>
<h6 class="toleft"> Question 2 </h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Time Period: 1, 1491-1607 </h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Key Concept: 1.1 B </h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Themes: Geography and the Enviroment </h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Skills: Causation </h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Question: Analyze how thr arid conditions of the Great Basin and the grasslands of the Western Great Plains influenced Native American lifestyles</h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Thesis Statement: Different conditions across North America led to a variety of different societies with different lifestyles. The Indian tribes that lived in the grasslands or basin notably had a mostly mobile lifestyle. </h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Connections: </h6>
<h6 class="toleft">	☆ Annual Migrations; following animals (ex: Buffalos) or routine </h6>
<h6 class="toleft">	☆ Led to significantly different cultures due to landscape </h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Contextuality: Most Native American tribes did not have a greater "organization" above them and were mostly self sufficient-leading to dozens of different languages in cultures depending on the location/enviorment </h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Complexity: Although the lack of unity within tribes, this did not lead to any great wars, and for the most part tribes coexisted with few wars, and little major wars. Unity only occused after colonial expansion forced them out of their land and harassed them.  </h6>
<br>
<h6 class="toleft"> Question 3 </h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Time Period: ​1491-1607 </h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Key Concept: ​1.2 (B) </h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Themes:​ Work and Exchange of Technology, Economy </h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Skills:​ Causation </h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Question:​ Analyze the effects that New World food crops had on European populations and economic systems. </h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Thesis:​ Because of the high caloric content of New World food crops like the potato, European populations could expand dramatically with the addition of those new crops. New World crops provided variety in the European diet, which provided for a better fed European population. Due to a stronger farmer class from the control of more productive crops, farmers could demand less hierarchical powers, leading to a shift from feudal economic structures to capitalism.</h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Connections to other time periods: Massive demand for Southern cotton and tobacco following the introduction of cotton and tobacco to the 13 colonies </h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Contextuality: This dependence on cheap grains has been reflected in Asian culturesv(rice), maize in latin america and so forth, with cheap energy always in demand </h6>
<h6 class="toleft"> Complexity: Such dependence on easy energy could backfire if a main crop was unable to produce, ex: Irish Potato Famine </h6>
<br>

<h6 class="toleft">Skills:​ Causation</h6>
<h6 class="toleft">Question:​ Analyze the extent to which the colonists developed an independent American identity before the French and Indian War.</h6>
<h6 class="toleft">Thesis Statement:​ Because the British paid little attention to their colonies, as per the principles of salutary neglect, the colonies were allowed to develop their own conceptions of identity. Much like in France, many colonists adopted independent Enlightenment thought, such as along the lines of Benjamin Franklin’s Enlightened thought, while mixing in British ideals like their commonwealthman tradition.

<h6 class="toleft">Thesis Statement:​ The victory over the French in the French and Indian War proved to be a boon to British imperial ambitions, however, it also produced massive financial costs that set the stage for the loss of all the territorial gains the crown had won through the Treaty of Paris in 1763. However, the crown did win some other things that made the Treaty of Paris a net benefit, for one, undisputed reign over the seas.</h6>
<h6 class="toleft">Connections:</h6>
